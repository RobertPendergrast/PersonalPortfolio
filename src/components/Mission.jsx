      <p>
        I build intelligent, resilient systems that operate where failure isn’t an option —
        whether in orbit, on embedded platforms, or in the wild. My focus is on flight software,
        firmware, robotics, and machine learning — applying computer science to real-world 
        environments where performance, efficiency, and autonomy matter most.
